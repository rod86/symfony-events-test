## Problems

Problems I came across

* I am used to symfony 3.2 so I didn't expect major changes in symfony 3.4 like the container.

* I couldn't setup a docker environment and I ended using a vagrant box.

* I don't know how events are related to places and types in the specs, so I supposed that's a many to one association to these 2 tables.


## Improvements

* API error listener: Setup an error exception listener to convert the error data if the request was an api call.

* separate the api actions and logic from the web application in a separate bundle.

* Move some controller logic to services.

* Improve services architecture.
